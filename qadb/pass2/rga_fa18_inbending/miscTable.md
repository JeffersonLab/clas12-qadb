# Misc Defect Comments Table for dataset `qadb/pass2/rga_fa18_inbending`

For each run, the table shows:
- `Misc` defect?:
  - "yes" if _any_ of the QA bins in this runs has the `Misc` defect
  - this does not mean this defect is present for the entire run
- Unique Comments:
  - each QA bin can have its own comment, which is usually set when a bin has the `Misc` defect
  - not all bins have to have the same comment
  - this table shows the _unique_ comments that are found for this run

See [the QADB table file](qaTree.json.table) for more detailed, bin-by-bin information.
