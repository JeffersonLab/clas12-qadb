# Groovy access to clasqaDB

- this directory contains the Groovy source code to access the QA database
- usage:
  - source the env.sh file (in `..`)
  - then run your analysis groovy script with `run-groovy` (from `coatjava`)
- see `test_*.groovy` scripts for examples
- the class defined in `clasqa/QADB.groovy` does the work
